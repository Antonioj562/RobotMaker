## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Strugging work with the data base but I did manage to create and update. I'm attempting to use the extenstion to continue to solve this.
After hours of frustration and with no avil with chatgpt I continued to ask my friend and he helped me debug my code for hours. It seemed that when I was trying to solve the intial router change with the unique id. I had the minconception of using layout as technical a navbar. Which all together that wasn't how it was supposed to be redone. He helped me through setting up my routes more effectively with numerous bugs occuring along the way while attempting to fix the detail page. After he helped me figure out the routes for the next day I retraced my steps at what he showed me to finish the update and delete portions.
